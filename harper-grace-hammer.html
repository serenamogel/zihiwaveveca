In the same case, &nbsp;the celebrity daughter, <strong>Harper Grace Hammer</strong>, has already grabbed media attention since her birth. Well, she is famous for being the firstborn child of actor <strong>Armie Hammer</strong> and former model<a href=#> <strong>Elizabeth Chambers</strong></a>.</p><p>Well, Grace is yet to start her own career. While her dad, Armie is best known for his work in movies such as <i>The Social Network</i> and <i>Call Me by Your Name</i>. While her mother, Chambers, has worked as a judge on TV shows like <i>Sugar Showdown</i>, <i>Chopped Sweets</i>, and <i>Cupcake Wars</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Personal Life</h2><p>Harper Grace is still under her parent's supervision. Thus for her, there is no chance to date anyone. Now, she is enjoying her childhood along with her parents, and she features mostly on their Instagram pages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/Capture-1599721150607.JPG><p>The little girl Hammer is in her school days at the moment. She also has a little brother named <a href=#>Ford Armand Douglas Hammer</a>, whom she loves so much. Currently, her parents say the main priority right now for them is to make their kids, Hyper and Ford's nothing changes&nbsp;for them even after their divorce.</p><h2>Are Harper's&nbsp;Parents Still Married?</h2><p>Unfortunately, 10 years of mating between Armie & Elizabeth has not worked out properly. Elizabeth and Armie tied the knot on May 22, 2010, in Southern California in an intimate ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>The glorious&nbsp;wedding ceremony was surrounded by a large gathering of loved ones and immediate families. Before saying Yes, I Do, they dated for three years. Their nuptials were featured in the issue of Town & Country in January 2011.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/HW_Rehearsal_0170p.original-1599721072533.jpg><p>However, the duo recently announced the split through their respective Instagrams by sharing a throwback snap of them on July 6, 2020. On Friday, July 11, 2020, Chambers <a href=# rel=nofollow>filed</a> a divorce citing irreconcilable differences in her petition.&nbsp;</p><p>The TV personality Chambers also requested for primary physical custody of their two children to the court and joint legal custody of the two. Also, she asked for spousal support.&nbsp;</p><p>Before announcing their division, the family of Hammer was self-quarantining in the Cayman Islands&nbsp;amid the&nbsp;coronavirus pandemic.</p><h2>Parent's Romance Began Out as a Triangle Love</h2><p>Yes, it is very true. The romance between her parents started differently from the beginning. They first met one day when the <i>Call Me by Your Name </i>actor had planned for trips with friends in Los Angeles back in 2006.</p><p>Their mutual friend even invited Elizabeth to an adventure day. The day, two were first introduced through Armie's friend named <strong>Tyler Ramsey</strong>,<strong> </strong>an artist. And the actor said it was love at first sight, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>“I felt like I’d been knocked over.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/9/10/Capture-1599721534561.JPG><p>But during that time, the tastemaker had a boyfriend. After their first meeting, they became good friends. But suddenly, there came the point where Hummer could not stop his feelings anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Then he asked her to break up with her boyfriend, saying that he couldn't be friends with her anymore. Surprisingly, that worked, and they began dating in 2008.</p><h2>Harper's Parents' Current Relationship</h2><p>Well, after parting ways with each other, both Harper's parents, Armie and Elizabeth are leading a single life. Both of them does not seem to be involved in any relationship.</p><p>They might be focusing on building a strong career in their respective field, and they might not have time to dare. Or they might have deliberately remained single for the moment.</p><h2>How Rich Are Harper's Parents?</h2><p>Harper Grace is just in her early years, so she is yet to make a career for herself. As of now, she is enjoying her childhood under her parents' assets. Whereas her father, Armie's net worth stands at <strong>$100000</strong>. He has earned this sum through his acting career.</p><p>His breakout 2010's film The Social Network was named one of the best films of the year by 78 critics, grossing <strong>$224.9 million </strong>worldwide against a budget of <strong>$40 Million</strong>. In the film, he portrayed the character of identical Winklevoss twins.</p><p>On the other hand, her mother, Elizabeth, has a whopping net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong>.&nbsp;She has accumulated her worth throughout her career as a journalist, TV personality, and journalist. She is popular for being the judge on the Food Network.</p><h2>Is Harper's Father Broke?</h2><p>Recently there have been several rumors regarding Armie Hammer's downfall as raised on the internet. As per reports, Armie was seen working as a share salesperson at a resort in the Cayman Islands. One anonymous person confirmed the <a href=# rel=nofollow>news to Variety </a>stating,</p><p>"<i>He is working at the resort and selling timeshares. He is working at a cubicle. The reality is he's totally broke, and is trying to fill the days and earn money to support his family.</i> "</p><p>However, it is still unsure if the actor really worked as a salesman or not as he has not confirmed the statement himself. Moreover, there are not enough evidence to confirm the ruimors.</p><h2>When Was Harper Born?</h2><p>Grace Hammer was born on December 1, 2014, in the United States.
