That year, he debuted professionally with the Yankees 1 of the Dominican Summer League (DSL).</p><p>Baseball America listed him as the Yankees’ ninth-best prospect prior to the 2014 season. Before getting called up to the Class A-Advanced Florida State League’s Tampa Yankees, Severino began the season with Charleston.</p><p>Due to Michael Pineda’s injury sustained in late July and the Yankees’ inability to acquire a starting pitcher before the trade deadline, general manager Brian Cashman declared that Severino’s upcoming start would take place at Yankee Stadium in the major leagues against the Yankees’ main rival, the Boston Red Sox.</p><p>Severino was a member of the Yankees starting rotation at the start of 2016. On May 13, 2016, Severino left a game against the Chicago White Sox due to what seemed to be an injury after allowing seven runs in 2.2 innings.</p><p>He was put on the 15-day disabled list the following day because of irritation in his right triceps. His deactivation from the disabled list and option to play for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders occurred on May 30, 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/02103006/1200x0-1-1024x683.jpg><p>After being called up again on July 25, he spent the rest of the season mostly as a reliever.

In five plus two and a third innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, he struck out seven and gave up one hit.</p><p>For the first time in his major league career, Severino shut out the Houston Astros 4-0 on May 2, 2018, pitching a complete game.</p><p>Severino inked a four-year, $40 million contract extension on February 15, 2019, which included a $12.25 million club option for a fifth season.</p><p>It was revealed on February 25, 2020, that Severino would have Tommy John surgery to fix a partially damaged ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, which would put an end to the 2020 campaign. On February 27, he had the procedure done formally and had a bone chip removed from his right elbow.</p><p>As Severino recovered from Tommy John surgery, he was put on the 60-day injured list on February 22, 2021. Severino was out until August after sustaining a groin injury on June 12, 2021, while in rehab with the Hudson Valley Renegades.</p><p>As Severino became the Yankee with the longest contract, Brett Gardner decided not to resign for the 2022 campaign. He was diagnosed with a low-grade right lat strain and put on the 60-day injured list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/02102629/usa_today_16802258.0-1024x683.jpg><p>Severino faced difficulties and irregularities in 2023.
