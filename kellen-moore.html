Kellen Christopher Moore was born on July 5, 1988, in Prosser, Washington. His father, Tom, was the head coach at Prosser High School from 1986 to 2008, winning 21 league titles and four state championships. Every day during football season, he and younger brother, Kirby, who also played at Boise State as a wide receiver, went from the elementary school to their dad’s football practice. As his father remembered in a 2011 interview, “He’d always have a little notepad with him. He was always drawing plays.” In his final two years of high school, his father let him call his own plays.</p><p>In January 2009, Moore was ranked as the 37th best returning player in college football by College Football News.</p><p>On March 28, 2011, the Sporting News named Moore as the #1 player in their annual list of the top 25 players in the nation.

He only needed 8 wins during the 2011 season to pass Colt McCoy for most wins by a quarterback in NCAA history. He threw his 100th touchdown pass against Georgia during week one. Following an opening season win against Georgia in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, Moore was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, distributed only in the west.</p><p>He was one of three finalists for the Maxwell Award along with Andrew Luck and Trent Richardson (won by Luck).
