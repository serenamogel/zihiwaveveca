He testified in a cold case several years later to get her justice. Kutcher was dating Ashley Ellerin in February 2001, around the period when he was starring in the hit 1998 sitcom, "That '70s Show," alongside Danny Masterson.</p><p class=dh>The couple had crossed paths on the Hollywood party scene as Ellerin, 22, socialized with some famous young people. She was a model and aspired to become a fashion designer.</p><p class=dh>Kutcher invited her to be his date at a Grammy's party and later went to her house to pick her up. But when he rang the doorbell upon arrival, no one answered. He peeked through the window and saw what he reportedly believed was wine on the floor. Once he realized there was no sign of his lover, he left the premises.</p><p class=dh>It turns out the television star saw Ellerin's blood that day. The young woman had been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpTWK1sNW4">stabbed 47 times</a> and laid dead behind the front door. The case reportedly went cold, and Kutcher moved on with his life. That was until more than ten years later; he was called to testify against a man believed to have killed his partner.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Kutcher Testified against a Serial Killer</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Several years after Ellerin's gruesome murder, police revealed evidence linking the heinous crime to Michael Gargiulo, "The Hollywood Ripper." He was also linked to the murders of two other victims, 18-year-old Trisha Picacho and 32-year-old Maria Bruno.</p><p class=dh>In an interview, Gargiulo denied being a serial killer, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQpTWK1sNW4">saying</a>, "This is a real nightmare that I'm living.
