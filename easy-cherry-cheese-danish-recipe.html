We’re talking a total of <strong>just six ingredients</strong> – including the powdered sugar you see dusted on top of the danishes. (And if you prefer icing or a glaze to powdered sugar, I give instructions on that below.)</p><p>The danish recipe may look super complicated and fancy, but just follow my step by step instructions below and refer to the images in the post as well.

You can halve the recipe and use a single sheet.</li><li><strong>cream cheese</strong> – use full fat cream cheese if you can</li><li><strong>granulated sugar</strong> – just a bit to sweeten up the cream cheese filling</li><li><strong>vanilla extract</strong> – another tasty option is to use Bourbon instead of vanilla</li><li><strong>cherry pie filling</strong> – I give other options below if cherries aren’t your thing</li><li><strong>powdered sugar for dusting</strong> – check out the glaze recipe below if you prefer that to powdered sugar</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/danish-ingredients-on-left-side-and-puff-pastry-cut-out-on-right-side.jpg alt="2 image collage with danish ingredients on left side and puff pastry cut out on right side" width=1200 height=892 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>How To Make Cherry Cheese Danishes</h2><li>Preheat oven to 400°.

Making 4 even squares.<br><p>Tip: Use a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=external>pizza cutter</a> to cut into squares. If you don’t have one, use a small, sharp paring knife.</p></li><li>Leaving a ½ centimeter edge, start ½ centimeter in from the corner and cut parallel to one side not quite to the middle. Start from where you cut at the corner and make an L going down the other side but not all the way to the middle. Do this on each corner. (see photo for example). Repeat on all 4 squares using a very sharp paring knife to make the cuts.</li><li>Once you have made the cuts, transfer the pastry to the prepared <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=external>baking sheet</a>.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cherry-cheese-danish-4-image-collage-of-how-to-cut-and-fold-the-danish.jpg alt="cherry cheese danish 4 image collage of how to cut and fold the danish" width=1200 height=982 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li><li>Mix cream cheese, sugar and Bourbon in a bowl.

Use my all time favorite tool: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=external>this dusting wand by OXO</a>. It gives perfect results every time. Don’t have a dusting wand? Use a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=external>small sifter or strainer like this</a>.</p><h2>Danish Glaze</h2><p>I chose to dust the top this danish recipe with some powdered sugar but another fun way to finish them off is with a simple glaze. Here’s how:</p><p>You just need two ingredients for this simple glaze:</p><ul><li>powdered sugar and</li><li>milk</li></ul><p>Simply whisk about half a cup of powdered sugar with two or so teaspoons of milk. If it’s too thick, add another teaspoon of milk. Too thin, add a tablespoon of powdered sugar. It’s really that easy!</p><p>Drizzle over the top of the baked danishes and serve!</p><h2>Working With Puff Pastry</h2><p>Puff pastry is the secret ingredient that makes this recipe so quick and easy to make but there are few things you should keep in mind.</p><li>Allow the frozen puff pastry to defrost in the fridge for several hours. If you are really short on time, you can defrost it at room temperature on a lightly floured surface, carefully flipping a few times as it defrosts.</li><li>Don’t let the pastry become soft because that means the butter is getting soft and&nbsp; you will start to lose the flakiness that puff pastry in known for. If your pastry gets too soft, return it to the fridge until it becomes firm again.</li><li>Since this recipe uses both sheets of puff pastry, leave one sheet in the fridge until you are ready to work with it. Likewise, it makes it rather simple to cut this recipe in half if you just want to use one sheet and make four danishes.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.momontimeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/top-down-view-of-all-of-the-cheese-danishes-with-cherries-on-a-tray-and-iwth-powdered-sugar.jpg alt="top down view of all of the cheese danishes with cherries on a tray and with powdered sugar" width=1200 height=1680 data-pin-description="This easy Cherry Cheese Danish recipe is fancy enough for holidays and special occasions yet simple enough to make on a Tuesday morning.

Another fun way to finish the danishes off is with some sliced almonds. In fact, you can add these just a few minutes before they are done baking and then top with the powdered sugar and glaze.
