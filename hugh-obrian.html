He practiced for ”a thousand hours or more” with the pistol. One of the reasons he was chosen for the role was his close physical resemblance to Wyatt Earp.</p><p>”I’m convinced that he was a thoroughly honest man, righteous and utterly fearless,” said O’Brian in an interview about Wyatt Earp. He added: ”He was also just. In 200 gunfights, he killed only four men.”</p><p>He was awarded the key to Lancaster by Mayor George Coe&nbsp;in 1963.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-31775 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hugh-OBrian-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Hugh O'Brian Net Worth" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hugh-OBrian-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-31775 class=wp-caption-text>© Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>From 1972 to 1973, he played Hugh Lockwood in ”Search,” an SF series produced by Anthony Spinner, John Strong, and Robert H.
