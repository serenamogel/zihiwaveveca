He had <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp5y-XMAx3P/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> some pictures alongside American CrossFit athlete Mal O’Brien, where he was training her while standing in crutches.</p><p>He used a dialogue from the 2006 comedy film Grandma’s Boy in the caption. The caption was, “*crutches* a few weeks ago, I got metal legs. It was a risky procedure, but it was worth it.”</p><p>After seeing Fraser in crutches, people began to worry about him and asked questions like, “What happened to Mat??” “Does anyone know what happened to Matt?” and “What happened with Mat’s Legs?”</p><p>Netizens also started to discuss the topic on Reddit after one Redditor <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/11u2lyv/frasers_surgery/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> the above-mentioned Instagram post’s screenshot with the caption, “Fraser’s surgery?” Under the Reddit thread, people jokingly mentioned that Fraser got height implants.</p><p>On the other hand, one user seemed to have genuine detail as he wrote, “Knee surgery to clean up some lingering issues – confirmed with folks at the Open announcement when he didn’t travel with Mal for 23.3.”</p><p>As for the actual reason, it has now been shared by the former <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/crossfit-athlete/ rel="noreferrer noopener">CrossFit athlete</a> himself on his social media handle. On Monday, March 27, 2023, he took to his Instagram handle to shed some light on the fan queries.</p><p>He <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqRL5vrg953/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> some pictures of himself where he was seen drinking coffee and resting in his bed while his right leg was wrapped in bandages and patches. “You’ve seen the crutches and lots of curiosity,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p>He continued, “Sometime in Feb I blew out my knee in a BJJ class — total fluke accident in the warmup (no, it was not with Amanda Nunes although she did kick my ass). Completely torn ACL, Grade 2 MCL, Grade 1 LCL & a tear in the Meniscus.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mathew-Fraser-In-Crutches-—-Did-He-Have-A-Knee-Surgery.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mathew Fraser recovering from his knee injury following surgery (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>As Fraser went on, he mentioned that he went to California in early March for his surgery and spent a “few weeks in PT.” “Now, back home on the regular schedule of coaching and working. Finding new ways to rehab and easing back into fitness as I heal,” he added.</p><p>In the end, he mentioned that he is very bummed about the condition of his leg but also cannot be too upset. He then wrote that he has been living his life outside the gym due to the injury but will return to his regular self/routine after a couple of months of recovery.</p><p>When Fraser revealed the real deal with his leg, his well-wishers rushed to the comment section and dropped positive comments. For instance, one wrote, “Really sorry for this news bro. Wishing you a quick recovery. Also hope It doesn’t deter you from BJJ.”</p><p>“Ah man! So sorry to hear (& see) that this happened. Admittedly, I love your positivity. This has always been one of your top qualities!” another user commented.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Furthermore, one user shared his own injury story and wrote, “Snapped mine in a rugby match a month ago. The surgery is on Tuesday finishing my 3rd week of prehab tomorrow looking forward to just getting the rehab started.”</p><p>To conclude, the retired Canadian-American professional CrossFit athlete blew out his knee and had major injuries during one of his Brazilian jiu-jitsu [BJJ] classes in February 2023. And now, he is resting and recovering after a successful knee surgery.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">All You Need to Know About Jevon Holland: The Highest-Profile Canadian in the NFL Right Now</h1><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nfl.jpg alt="All You Need to Know About Jevon Holland: The Highest-Profile Canadian in the NFL Right Now" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>There are 18 Canadian players on the active rosters of NFL teams in the 2023-24 season. None are catching the eye more than Jevon Holland. The 23-year-old Coquitlam-born safety was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2021 after impressing in two seasons of college football with the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Holland has not looked back ever since, establishing himself as a regular in the Dolphins team, posting some serious tackle and interception figures.</p><p>In fact, Holland is now the starting free safety position for Miami. So far in 2023, Holland has registered 44 solo tackles, just four shy of the 48 he amassed in his entire debut season in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland and the Dolphins are in great shape for a 2024 Super Bowl bid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mathew-fraser-recovering-from-knee-injury.jpg><p>Holland could be celebrating winning his first Lombardi Trophy next year too if the bookmakers’ odds are to be believed. The Dolphins are currently rated as +800 fifth favorites to land the 2024 Super Bowl with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ontario-licensed sports betting online operator Betano</a>, which has served the Canadian province since receiving its license in October 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland’s first ever NFL touchdown was a big one – in more ways than one!</h2><p>Holland played a key role in the Dolphins’ recent victory over the New York Jets. Holland completed a stunning interception of a hail Mary pass, before returning it with interest for a stunning 99-yard touchdown. It was the first touchdown of Holland’s NFL career and it steered Miami to a comfortable 34-13 victory.</p><p>It’s a win which keeps Miami firmly top of the AFC East. In fact, only the Baltimore Ravens have made a better start to the 2023-24 NFL season in the AFC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The British Columbian safety did more than assist the Dolphins in their quest for victory over the Jets that day. His full-field return triggered an eagerly anticipated giveaway worth over $1 million. During the NFL preseason, electronics firm TCL launched its “Ultimate Gameday Upgrade” committing to give away $1 million worth of 98” televisions if a player managed to score a touchdown from a minimum of 98 yards in.</p><p>Holland beat the minimum by a single yard. TCL also made sure Holland received a 98” TV too, as reward for his feat.</p><p>Holland has missed the last few games for the Dolphins after sustaining a sprain to his medial ligaments in both knees. This disappointing injury was suffered in the same game as his majestic touchdown against the Jets.</p><p>The team continues to use kid gloves with Holland, pushing him only sparingly into team practice. Holland himself admits <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s “taking his time” with his rehab</a> to ensure he returns at the peak of his powers.</p><p>The Dolphins realize just how important Holland has become to their defense, as he also serves as the quarterback of the secondary. Head coach Mike McDaniel described Holland as being “diligent” with his recovery, especially with the chance of a deep postseason run looming.</p><p><strong>Holland’s path to NFL stardom</strong></p><p>Miami is reaping the rewards of recognizing Holland’s undoubted potential in the NFL after making him their second-round pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Holland had impressed during his scholarship with the Oregon Ducks in the <a href=#>same way as outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux</a>, who was later recruited by the New York Giants.</p><p>Holland’s rookie season saw him display his physical prowess from day one. He exhibited a rare combination of athleticism, football intelligence, and a knack for disrupting opposing offenses. His ability to cover ground in the secondary, make crucial tackles, and create turnovers has earned him rave reviews from Dolphins fans and respect from his peers across the league.</p><p>Beyond his on-field contributions, Holland’s leadership qualities and adaptability have also been noteworthy. Whether patrolling the backfield or contributing on special teams, Holland has quickly established himself as a versatile asset to the Dolphins.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Congrats to the couple!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Santi-Aldama-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Santi Aldama is a Spanish professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association’s (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>) Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Before being drafted into the NBA, he was a Loyola Greyhounds basketball player in college.

He scored his career high in February 2023 and got engaged to his girlfriend in September 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s relationship with future wife and dating history</h2><p>Aldama has been dating his girlfriend, Pilar Barquin, for quite some time. He is very secretive about his personal life, so he has not revealed anything about his dating history or his past relationships.</p><p>As a result of his privacy, it’s unknown if he had dated anyone before he began dating his future wife. Similarly, the details of his relationship with his girlfriend-turned-fiancee are not known. It is unknown when the duo first met or how they started dating.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, it looks like they have been together before the summer of 2021. Barquin first posted her boyfriend on Instagram in July 2021.</p><p>She <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR9rgfkr52b/?img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a series of photos with his with the caption, “un día más admirándote y sintiéndome la persona más afortunada del mundo!! Enhorabuena,” which roughly translates to “One more day admiring you and feeling like the luckiest person in the world!! Congratulations.”</p><p>Since then, Barquin has been more comfortable sharing photos of her boyfriend on her social media. On the other hand, Aldama first posted about his girlfriend and revealed that he was dating Barquin in May 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they have been dating, Aldama and his girlfriend have celebrated Christmas together with their family. After dating for at least two years, the duo got engaged in September 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nfl.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Santi Aldama might get married to his girlfriend soon.

Aldama has not referred to Barquin as his wife, and neither has Barquin referred to the athlete as her husband.</p><p>So, it looks like the two are not married yet but might be planning for their dream wedding. For now, fans of the NBA star will have to wait patiently to see their favorite player share the wedding vows with his partner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s family and career</h2><p>Aldama was raised in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Gran Canaria, Spain.

He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lured</a> to the school because his father knew assistant coach Ivo Simovi and because Aldama hoped to one day work in business, and he felt at ease when he visited in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Many analysts were surprised by Aldama’s decision to play for a mid-major program as he was considered a four-star recruit and a high-major player.&nbsp;</p><p>Aldama was out for the first three months of his rookie season due to a knee ailment that necessitated surgery. On February 1, 2020, he made his college debut for Loyola Maryland, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">scoring</a> 11 points in 17 minutes in a 79-73 win over Navy.</p><p>In four weeks, Aldama was voted Patriot League Rookie of the Week three times.
