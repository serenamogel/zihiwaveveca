But, his journey to the biggest stage of all wasn’t easy. He had his hardships, including a father who walked out on his family, and a mother, Londa Butler who kicked him out of his own house. By the age of 13, Jimmy found himself without a home. But, that didn’t last very long. The Miami Heat star was taken in by a friend’s family, where he had more siblings than he could count.</p><p class=advertisement>Advertisement</p><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-2 class=data-event>It’s a gut-wrenching story, albeit one that has a happy ending. But, <strong><a rel=noopener data-utm_source=article data-utm_medium=content data-utm_campaign=link href=#>who exactly is Londa Butler</a></strong>? What does she do? And, what were her reasons for kicking Jimmy Buckets out?</p><h2>Meet Londa Butler, the medical office receptionist who kicked Jimmy Butler out</h2><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-3 class=data-event>Born in Tomball, Texas in 1989, Jimmy Butler was the son of Jimmy Butler II and Londa Butler. As an infant, Butler’s biological father walked out on his family, leaving a young Jimmy and his mother to fend for themselves.</p><p class=advertisement>Advertisement</p><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-4 class=data-event>His mother, Londa is a Tomball native. She reportedly studied at Tomball High School, before going to Lone Star College to become a medical office receptionist. Following her education, she worked for a while as the same but now works as a caregiver, assisting elderly and incapacitated patients.</p><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-5 class=data-event>As for her relationship with her son, Londa took care of Jimmy until he was 13. And, while the reasons for her decision to kick her son out vary, it is either one of two things: She found it difficult to handle a troublesome 13-year-old, or as many gossip columns would have you believe, she “didn’t like the look of him.”</p><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-7 class=data-event>He was pretty much homeless. But, while he doesn’t fully agree with that sentiment, his fortunes changed when <strong><a data-utm_source=article data-utm_medium=content data-utm_campaign=link href=#>he was taken in by Michelle Lambert</a></strong>. The mother of his friend Jordan Leslie, who already had six other siblings.</p><h2>Jimmy Buckets has an amicable relationship with his biological mother</h2><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-8 class=data-event>Despite all they have been through, Jimmy Butler and his mother have quite an amicable relationship now. Butler spends his off-seasons in Houston and even hangs out with his mother on occasion. He has even gone on to state that he does not hold grudges and would much rather leave the past behind.</p><p class=advertisement>Advertisement</p><p data-type=content data-variant=p id=article-content-block-10 class=data-event>It certainly was a tough childhood. But, it is all of this that has made him into the man he is today. And, with all that has happened, it’s great to see that he does not let his past decide his actions.</p><p class=advertisement>Advertisement</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqrraOde6S7zGilm5ldo7K4v4yjoKalqWKvtsDLnqlmpZ%2Bieri0zmagrGWdnq6utYyhnJqsXajBor7SZqSorJiav264zqebmmWSqsGtsdFo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-sean-kingston.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Sean Kingston?">&larr;
