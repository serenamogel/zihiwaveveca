Three years later, his passion for interacting with wildlife was in full force, as he helped reign in problem crocodiles by wrestling them into a boat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Irwin’s love for all creatures — and his knack for being able to handle them so skillfully — soon translated into a career. In 1991, he started managing Beerwah Reptile and Fauna Park, which his parents had run since 1970, and eventually changed the name to the Australia Zoo. His larger-than-life enthusiastic personality also paved the way to global television fame, most notably in the TV documentary series The Crocodile Hunter from 1997 to 2004.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By July 2006, Irwin was on top of the world. He was married to the love of his life, American Terri Irwin (née Raines), and dad to daughter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/bindi-irwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bindi class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bindi</a> and son Robert — plus he and Terri had just plotted out a 10-year plan for Australia Zoo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So when he took off to film a documentary in Queensland's Batt Reef, it just seemed like another adventure. He had already hosted a 2001 special called The Ten Deadliest Snakes in the World, so the fact that this one was called Ocean’s Deadliest didn’t faze him one bit — after all, he was committed to spreading the word about compassion for all creatures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I believe that the time has come where if we don't get animals into people's hearts, they're going to go extinct,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/25/lkl.01.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he told Larry King" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he told Larry King</a> in 2004. “We're running out of time right now.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Little did he know that it would be an ocean creature — one that’s not even considered to be all that dangerous — that would ultimately take his life in a freak ocean accident on September 4, 2006, at the age of 44.</p><img alt="Staff members from the Australia Zoo console each other as they observe tributes outside the zoo on September 6, 2006, following the death of Steve Irwin" title="Staff members from the Australia Zoo console each other as they observe tributes outside the zoo on September 6, 2006, following the death of Steve Irwin" width=2464 height=1632 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-71791699.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Heather Faulkner/AFP via Getty Images</span><p>Staff members from the Australia Zoo console each other as they observe tributes outside the zoo on September 6, 2006, following the death of Steve Irwin</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Irwin and his friend were killing time during a rain delay when they discovered the eight-foot-wide stingray</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While various accounts spread about his unbelievable death, ultimately it was the one person by his side that day who shared the details of the devastating day on Australia’s morning show <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeydzMjP4Oo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studio 10" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Studio 10</a>, eight years later in 2014.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cameraman Justin Lyons was one of Irwin’s closest confidantes. They had worked together for 15 years and Irwin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/crocodile-hunter-steve-irwins-final-words-im-dying-n49176 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="considered him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">considered him</a> his “best mate” and “right-hand man.” “We were very close,” Lyons said on the show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He also knew how excited Irwin was to work on this particular documentary where they would come face to face with the ocean’s deadliest creatures, like sharks and sea snakes. “[It’s] all the things that would normally make people cringe, this is what Steve loved, so he was very excited about it,” Lyons recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They were about eight days into the shoot and were on the search for tiger sharks, but hit a patch of bad weather. “Steve was like a caged tiger when he couldn’t do something, particularly on a boat, ” Lyon said. “So he said, ‘Let’s go and do something,’ so we jumped into the inflatable [boat] and off we went to look for something to do.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It didn’t take long for them to find a gigantic eight-foot-wide stingray that would be perfect footage for another project they had in the pipeline. Like they had so many times before, they made a plan, and got ready to shoot in the chest-deep waters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Stingrays are normally very calm. If they don’t want you around them, they’ll swim away — they’re very fast swimmers,” Lyons explained. Things were going well and they figured they’d do one last shot. The stingray was between the two of them and Irwin would swim toward the camera and Lyons would film the ray swimming away.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The stingray's barb 'went through his chest like a hot knife through butter'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But things didn’t go as planned. “All of a sudden, it propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail, hundreds of strikes in a few seconds,” Lyons remembers, noting that the “powerful” animals have been around for 60 million years. “It probably thought Steve’s shadow was a tiger shark, who feeds on them pretty regularly, so it started to attack him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even under those circumstances, Lyons focused on his work. “We had this rule that if Steve was ever hurt or injured, that we had to keep filming no matter what,” he said in the interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn’t until Lyons turned back that he realized the tail strikes had gone straight into Irwin. “Steve was standing in a huge pool of blood that I realized something had gone wrong,” Lyons said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first priority was to get out of the water since the blood would surely attract sharks. While some reports said that the stingray's barb was pierced into Irwin’s body and he pulled it out himself, Lyons clarifies that didn’t happen. “It’s a jagged sharp barb and it went through his chest like a hot knife through butter,” the witness described.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Initially, Irwin thought it punctured his lung. All they could tell was that there was a two-inch injury right over his heart with blood pouring out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He had an extraordinary threshold for pain, so I knew that when he was in pain that it must have been painful,” Lyons said. “Even if we'd been able to get him into an emergency ward at that moment, we probably wouldn't have been able to save him because the damage to his heart was massive.”</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Irwin’s last words were 'I’m dying'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">They managed to get Irwin back into the inflatable boat, with one crew member keeping his hand over the wound and Lyons reminding Irwin to think of his kids: “He just sort of calmly looked up at me and said, ‘I’m dying’ — and that was the last thing he said.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When they got back to the main boat called Croc 1, Lyons started CPR on him. “There’s always hope,” Lyons admitted. “We hoped for a miracle. I literally did CPR on him for over an hour.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But when they finally got him to medics, the prognosis was clear. “They pronounced him dead within 10 seconds of looking at him,” Lyons said.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Stingrays are usually the 'pussycats of the ocean'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the tragedy, critics came out and said Irwin must have been behaving irresponsibly for something to go so wrong. But toxicologist Jamie Seymour was also on board Croc 1 that day and says that’s simply not true. “They weren't there, they didn't know what happened,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/10/16/steve-irwin-stingray data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Seymour told WBUR’s Endless Thread" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Seymour told WBUR’s Endless Thread</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In fact, even though they were there to look for the tiger sharks, Seymour and Irwin had specifically talked about the potential damage that a stingray’s tail could do as well. “It was just a really bad accident — if he’d been five feet one side or coming from another direction or the sun had been somewhere else, wouldn’t have happened…by and large, these things are referred to as pussycats of the ocean. They’re not an issue, but just under some circumstances, it goes wrong.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Daughter Bindi says 'it’s like losing a part of your heart'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His beloved daughter Bindi was only 8 years old at the time and Robert was just 2. “I remember people coming up to me and saying, ‘I’m sorry for your loss, sweetheart. Time heals all wounds.’ But that’s just not true,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/bindi-irwin-steve-heartbreak-legacy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bindi told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bindi told People</a> in 2018. “It’s like losing a part of your heart, and when you’ve lost that, you never get it back.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Knowing how much his children meant to him, Lyons made sure they were in his final thoughts — but ultimately, it was a fate no one expected. “He was so good with animals nothing was going to get him,” Lyons added. “We thought he was gonna live forever but it would always be a crazy silly accident, and as it turns out that's exactly what it was.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwv9OerZ5lmafEqrqMnKmom5%2BZtq2xjKGsp6yVp3qlscCtnw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./colton-haynes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colton Haynes  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
