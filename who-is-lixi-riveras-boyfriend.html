They also mentioned that they squandered their opportunity to spend their early adulthood as self-sufficient individuals.</p><p>They ended the video by saying that they made a promise while they were together, that they would be friends even after they split up, and that they were open to dating one other in the future if the stars aligned. Here’s the video in which they announced their split.</p><h2>Andrew Davila: Lixi Rivera’s Current Boyfriend</h2><p><strong>Lexi Rivera</strong> has reportedly been linked to creator Andrew Davila, with whom she frequently collaborates.
