The Fox News Channel carries both of his programs. From 2007 to 2015, Gutfeld served as the host of the late-night chat show 3 AM series Red Eye, which was also broadcast on the Fox News Channel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Greg Gutfeld career</h2><p>After graduating from college, Gutfeld worked as R. Emmett Tyrrell’s assistant at The American Spectator.</p><p>Later, he had positions as an editor for several Rodale Press journals as well as a staff writer for Prevention magazine.</p><p>He joined Men’s Health as a staff writer in 1995. In 1999, he received a promotion to editor-in-chief of Men’s Health. He was replaced by David Zinczenko a year later.</p><p>Then Gutfeld was appointed chief editor of Stuff, which was then a Dennis Publishing publication. Circulation rose from 750,000 to 1.2 million during his leadership.</p><p>In 2003, Gutfeld paid several dwarfs to attend a Magazine Publishers of America meeting on the subject of “buzz,” with the directive to be as obnoxious and loud as possible.</p><p>Gutfeld was sacked from Dennis Publishing shortly after the publicity-generating prank, and he later took on the role of head of “brain development” there.</p><p>From 2004 to 2006, he served as editor of Maxim magazine in the United Kingdom. After readership declined while he was editor, Gutfeld’s contract was not renewed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/25074046/image-230-1024x607.png><p>From the beginning of The Huffington Post in 2005 until October 2008, Gutfeld was one of the first poster contributors. He frequently singled out Deepak Chopra, Cenk Uygur, and Arianna Huffington as targets in his commentary.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the Fox News Channel, Gutfeld hosted the late-night conversation program Red Eye starting on February 5, 2007. The one-hour program debuted at 2:00 A.M. ET, Monday through Saturday, and 11:00 P.M. ET, Saturday.</p><p>However, the program started broadcasting at 3:00 A.M. Monday through Saturday mornings starting in October 2007, keeping its 11:00 P.M. timeslot on Saturday evenings.</p><p>Bill Schulz was Gutfeld’s sidekick from 2007 until 2013, and Andy Levy handled complaints on the program. Levy and Schulz both worked for Stuff magazine as bloggers, and Schulz had previously worked with Gutfeld there.</p><p>On July 11, 2011, Gutfeld joined the panel and co-hosted The Five on Fox News, a weekday 5:00 PM ET political talk show.</p><p>Red Eye was hosted by Tom Shillue after Gutfeld quit the show in February 2015. The Greg Gutfeld Show, a new weekly late-night chat show on Fox News, premiered on May 31, 2015, at 10:00 p.m. ET on Saturdays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/25074313/image-233.png><p>The switch to weeknights at 11:00 PM ET, which would take effect in the second quarter of 2021, was announced in February of that year.</p><p>On March 10, 2021, it was revealed that Gutfeld!, a new evening program, will debut on April 5.
