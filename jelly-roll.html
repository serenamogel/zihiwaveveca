This turbulent past has helped inspire some of his most famous songs. Although he started in rap and hip-hop, the Tennessee native has emerged as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/country-singers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="country music star" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">country music star</a>.

His father, Horace “Buddy” DeFord, ran a wholesale meat business and had a side hustle as a bookie. Jelly Roll also has three older half-siblings: brothers Roger and Scott and a sister named Shelby.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jelly Roll’s mother, who struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues, gave him his nickname—and now, stage name—in his youth because he was a “chubby kid.” The singer said his mother, whose name hasn’t been made public, was why he first fell in love with music and became a good storyteller.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around age 9 or 10, he wrote his first rap song. “I just remember thinking, ‘I want to make music that makes people feel like this music makes my mother feel,’” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://americansongwriter.com/the-meaning-behind-the-sugary-name-jelly-roll/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he said</a> during a May 2022 interview with the Bobby Bones Show.

One of the most serious charges was aggravated robbery when he was 16. He was charged as an adult and faced up to 20 years in prison, though he ultimately served a little over a year in jail and received more than seven years’ probation. “I hadn’t hit my last growth spurt. I was charged as an adult years before I could buy a beer, lease an apartment, get a pack of cigarettes,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/features/jelly-roll-whitsitt-chapel-interview-1235343219/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he told" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he told</a> Billboard. “I feel like the justice system at that point kind of parked me on my only set path.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Because of Tennessee’s zero-tolerance policy for violent offenders, the charge is still on the singer’s record.

The singer now visits rehabilitation facilities to help educate and inspire other people working through addiction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 23, Jelly Roll was incarcerated for drug dealing. He was in prison on May 22, 2008, when he learned from a correctional officer that he had become a father. He credits the birth of his daughter, Bailee, as the catalyst that turned his life around. “It’s like a Damascus Road experience in the Bible,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/g43498736/jelly-roll-facts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he told" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he told</a> podcaster Joe Rogan. “I immediately was like, ‘I’ve got to do something.

Shortly after his release from prison, he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn30i8WQKoc" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="uploaded a video clip" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">uploaded a video clip</a> to YouTube called “10 Minute Freestyle,” showing him freestyle rapping about his drug dealing, incarceration, and other elements of his past. The video caught the attention of rapper Lil Wyte, who was starting his own record label and wanted to collaborate with Jelly Roll for the 2011 album Year Round. The two worked with fellow rapper BPZ on the project and called themselves SNO.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jelly Roll said Wyte was one of the first artists to recognize his potential as a singer. “I’ll never forget Wyte looking at me and going: ‘That’s what you need to do,’” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hiphopdx.com/news/jelly-roll-credits-lil-wyte-changing-career data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he told" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he told</a> HipHopDx. “I didn’t know anything about music, so I was like, ‘Nah, I’m just harmonizing.’ Now I know what a harmony is, and it’s the opposite of what I was doing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Jelly Roll’s album with Nashville rapper Haystak titled Strictly Business ranked a modest No. 67 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. He collaborated with Wyte again for the 2013 album No Filter, which hit No. 17 on the Top Rap Albums chart. Then, in 2017, he partnered with his friend Struggle Jennings for a rap album titled Waylon & Willie—named after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/waylon-jennings data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Waylon Jennings" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Waylon Jennings</a>, Struggle’s step-grandfather, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/willie-nelson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Willie Nelson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Willie Nelson</a>. The pair turned the album into a series with three more releases over the next three years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jelly Roll occasionally sang on these albums but was hesitant to do so for an entire track.

With its highly personal theme of coping with hopelessness, not to mention the singer’s impressive vocals, the song drew the attention of music executives. “I saw that pain, vulnerability, that tenderness,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/features/jelly-roll-whitsitt-chapel-interview-1235343219/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said Jon Loba" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said Jon Loba</a>, the BMG Nashville record label president. “I loved his vocal.

I don’t know where you’re at in your life or what you’re going through, but I want to tell you to keep going, baby. I want to tell you success is on the other side of it. I want to tell you that the windshield is bigger than the rearview mirror for a reason because what’s in front of you is so much more important than what’s behind you!” he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jelly Roll was soon nominated for his first two Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance for his collaboration with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a46027447/lainey-wilson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lainey Wilson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lainey Wilson</a> on “Save Me.” Although he didn't win that night, he more than made up for it at the CMT Awards in April 2024 with three victories—including overall Video of the Year for “Need a Favor.”</p><h2 data-node-id=44 title="Wife and Children" data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><img alt="jelly roll and wife bunnie xo smiling for red carpet photographers at an awards show" title="Jelly Rolly is married to model and podcaster Bunnie Xo" width=3880 height=2587 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jelly-roll-and-bunnie-xo-attend-the-58th-academy-of-country-news-photo-1697212880.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo, his wife, attend the ACM Awards in May 2023.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Jelly Roll met model Bunnie Xo following his concert at the Country Saloon in Las Vegas.
