Stephen was a politician, horse breeder, and farmer who told his daughter stories of the American Indian Wars—helping Clara learn the importance of keeping an army equipped with food, clothing, and medical supplies. This would prove crucial later in her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Barton already had a talent with words by age 4, when she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/enterprise-assets/about-us/history/history-clara-barton-v5-4-19-23.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="started school" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">started school</a> and was able to spell three-syllable words.

On the advice of phrenologist Lorenzo Niles Fowler, Barton began preparing to become a school teacher. She passed her examinations and began teaching near her home in Oxford in 1839. Barton later studied for a year at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York, beginning in 1850.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Famous Women of History</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Teaching Career" data-anchor-id=teaching-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Teaching Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After moving to New Jersey in 1851, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.clarabartonbirthplace.org/claras-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she opened" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she opened</a> the state’s first free public school in Bordentown.

However, when Bordentown residents built a new schoolhouse in 1853, they decided to make a man the principal—at twice the salary of Barton. An irate Barton quit the school and teaching altogether.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Instead, Barton moved to Washington, D.C., to work in the U.S. Patent Office as a clerk in the mid-1850s.

At the beginning, she collected and distributed supplies for the Union Army. Not content sitting on the sidelines, Barton served as an independent nurse and first saw combat in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1862. She also cared for soldiers wounded at Antietam in Maryland. Barton was nicknamed “the angel of the battlefield” for her work.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Important Civil War Figures</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Initially, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nps.gov/clba/learn/historyculture/cbpaving.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barton’s help" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barton’s help</a> was often declined, as no woman had ever appeared directly on the battlefield, in camps, or in field hospitals.
