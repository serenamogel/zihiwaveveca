carried out the attack.</p><p>They claim that she used the Apple Maps app on her phone to time his trip and make sure she had enough time to kill each child.</p><p>They also argue that she could have

been “smiling” and “happy” earlier that day and that she had been having “one of her best days” after a long struggle with anxiety.</p><p>He also said that she had been hospitalized for anxiety at a psychiatry facility in the weeks leading up to their children’s deaths.</p><p>Patrick Clancy has expressed his grief and forgiveness for his wife in a statement and on a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $1 million for him.</p><p>He said that his wife had a medical condition that he did not specify, but that might have been a contributing factor in the deaths of their children.</p><p>He also said that their marriage was wonderful and grew stronger as her condition worsened.</p><p>Patrick asked people to find it deep within themselves to forgive Lindsay, as he had.</p><p>He said that she loved being a nurse and a mother and that her passion taught him how to be a better father.</p><h2><span id=Patrick_Clancy>Patrick Clancy</span></h2><p>Patrick Clancy is a software engineer who works
